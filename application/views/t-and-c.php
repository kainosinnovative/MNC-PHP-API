                                application, Trivz (&ldquo;<b>Application</b>&rdquo;) for facilitating an Owner to provide a Customer with a ride
                                in the car and allowing him to carry out inspection of the car model. The Owner shall give the
                                Customer an honest feedback about the car in addition to the test drive, to enable the Customer
                                to take an informed decision based on the true feel of the car, for which Dreamz shall pay the
                                Owner a certain specified amount as consideration (&ldquo;<b>Dreamz Service(s)</b>&rdquo;). The Owner, at his
                                sole discretion, is entitled to allow the Customer to drive the car. The Application is developed
                                to facilitate Dreamz Services amongst users of smart phone devices. The Users are required to
                                sign up and register themselves as either an owner, willing to provide their car for Dreamz
                                Services to a Customer (&ldquo;<b>Owner</b>&rdquo;) or as a customer, intending to inspect a specific car model,

                                to help organize that data.</p>

                                have two options, one is by way of providing their mobile number which will be authenticated
                                by an OTP, and the other is by providing a valid email address and password in line with the
                                prescribed instructions and requirements as maybe specified in the Application. At the time of
                                registration, the User is also required to provide all the correct, mandatory and relevant details
                                as specifically asked for and as maybe specified in the hyperlink. Confirmation of registration
                                on the Application will be sent by way of an e-mail/SMS/notification to the Users coordinates,
                                as provided in the registration form. Upon completion of the registration process and subject to

                                <p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Each user may opt to register itself as an Owner or Customer and provide all the relevant
                                information as maybe specified. Upon such registration with the Application, the Owners shall
                                allow Dreamz or its affiliates, to carry out inspection of the car in order to ensure that the car
                                details and all other information that may be provided by the Owner at the time of registration,
                                are accurate and that the car is in a good condition for the Customer to be able to take a test
                                drive. After such information is provided, registration is completed, and inspection is carried
                                out, the system will select the car and auto allocate the Owner on the basis of the requirements
                                stated by the Customer. The Customer will not have the option to choose the Owner. If the
                                Owner is available and the Customers’ requirements match with the details provided by the
                                Owner, then upon confirmation from both the ends, the Owner must provide a ride to the
                                Customer in order to give him a true touch and feel of the car. Where no Owner is available that
                                can match the Customers specification, Dreamz may direct the request to the car dealer nearest
                                to the Customer who has the same car model as requested, for Dreamz Services to be carried
                                out.</p>

                                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                <p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">The system will not assign the Dreamz Services to the same Owner and Customer who appear
                                to have the same combination of mobile numbers, more than once. Owners can list multiple
                                cars at a time and need to make Dreamz aware of its timely status. An Owner may provide their
                                car for Dreamz Services only 10 times in a month and a Customer can avail Dreamz Services
                                only 5 times in a month. If the Customer intends to conduct the drive himself, he may request
                                the Owner for the same. The Owner may permit the Customer to drive at the Owner’s sole
                                discretion and neither Dreamz nor the Customer shall have any right to compel the Owner to
                                allow the Customer to drive the car.</p>

                                <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

                                <p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Further, to authenticate the process, an OTP is generated on the mobile number/ email address
                                of the Users which acts as a password when the Users meet. This OTP helps to ensure that no
                                other person, other than the registered Users, will be able to use the Dreamz Services. If OTP
                                is furnished and the Dreamz Services have been completed, the Owner will receive a specified
                                amount of consideration from Dreamz within 7 working days. But, if OTP is not furnished at
                                that time, by either of the Users, the Dreamz Services stands unsuccessful for which we shall
                                not be held liable. After confirmation from both the ends is received, a masked mobile number
                                and other relevant information about the participating Owner and Customer will be shared 24
                                hours prior to the time and day for which the Dreamz Services are booked.</p>
